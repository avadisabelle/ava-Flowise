_GEMINII_DEFAULT_MODEL_set pro;geminiid "in @_sessiondata/5a90248b-cba1-4a79-9131-0c60ea23c441 is what claude-online prepared for the job.  In /src/home/jgi/.claude/CLAUDE.md are embodiments for yourself todo the job, you would bring yourself in here and create a GEMINI.md for observing and seeing this whole work going on.  in /src/palimpsest/mia-agents/agents/ maybe Mia will see some agents that we can have do some work (maybe claude-online needs our help). as we progress, we might have to create a claude.ai skill in /src/palimpsest/skills-mia/ to help mobile agent contributing.

if you look in @_env.sh you should understand which trace_id to get and in which session using the coaiapy_aetherial.
	We are still at the EAST direction (see: /src/IAIP/directions) and making sure the SOUTH is adequate.
