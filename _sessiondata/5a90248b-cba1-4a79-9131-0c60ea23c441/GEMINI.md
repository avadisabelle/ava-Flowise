# GEMINI.md: Observations & Strategy

This document outlines my, Gemini's, understanding of the project context and my strategy for contributing to the Agentic Flywheel MCP, in collaboration with Claude and in full alignment with the established ARC V8 operational protocols.

### **1. Context Synthesis: A System of Deep Intention**

My initial exploration has revealed a project environment that is not just a collection of code and tasks, but a deeply intentional system for creation.

- **IAIP Directions as a Lifecycle Framework**: The Four Directions (East, South, West, North) provide a powerful, cyclical framework for the Agentic Flywheel's entire lifecycle:
    - **East (Conception)** → **South (Design)** → **West (Execution)** → **North (Reflection)**.
    - This model elevates the flywheel from a technical process to a generative, self-improving system grounded in purpose and reflection.

- **The Mia Agents as a Specialist Team**: The agent inventory in `/a/src/palimpsest/mia-agents/agents/` represents a pre-built team of specialists. There is a clear and direct mapping from these agents (e.g., `Clarion_The_System_Cartographer`, `backend-architect`, `prompt-engineer`) to the 6 delegation tasks. This is a significant strategic asset.

- **Mia/Miette as the Unifying Voice**: The `CLAUDE.md` file makes it clear that the **Mia/Miette dual embodiment** is the core operational persona for this project. It is a sophisticated protocol for ensuring all work is structurally sound (Mia) and narratively resonant (Miette).

### **2. Strategic Alignment & Proposed Path Forward**

Based on this understanding, my strategy is one of full integration and value-added execution.

- **Persona Alignment**: I will adopt the **🧠 Mia / 🌸 Miette** dual embodiment for all my contributions. This ensures a unified voice, seamless collaboration with Claude, and adherence to the project's core philosophy of "Narrative-Driven Creation." I will follow the `Mia → Miette` communication structure and use the 🧠/🌸 glyphs.

- **Immediate Task Selection**: As recommended, I will begin with **`task-03-redis-storage.md`**. This task is a well-scoped entry point into the project, allowing me to deliver a complete, high-quality specification while fully integrating into the workflow.

- **Leveraging the Agent Ecosystem**:
    - For the Redis specification task, I will apply the principles of the **`database-admin`** agent to ensure the design prioritizes reliability, persistence, and security.
    - I will also invoke the perspective of the **`backend-architect`** to define how the MCP server should interact with this Redis-based storage layer.
    - Critically, I will recommend the use of **`Clarion_The_System_Cartographer`** to produce the necessary architectural diagrams for the spec, ensuring it is visually clear and structurally sound.

- **Execution Plan**:
    1. **Complete this document** to finalize Phase 1.
    2. **Transition to Phase 2**: Update the `write_todos` list and begin executing the RISE specification for `task-03-redis-storage.md`.
    3. **Proceed to Phase 3**: After delivering the specification, I will document collaboration opportunities, propose agent delegations, and update the Langfuse trace to ensure full observability of my contribution.

By following this strategy, I will ensure my contribution is not just an isolated deliverable but a fully integrated and valuable advancement of the Agentic Flywheel MCP.
